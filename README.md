Power BI dashboard and report for Financial Sample database
FINANCIAL SAMPLE
CREATED BY: NABIL MOHAMMED SHAJAHAN
In this report, I will be analysing the financial database of a company in 2013 and 2014. This database covers key aspects like selling prices, cost prices, profits, discounts offered, and number of units sold. This database also provides additional information such as business segments they dealt with, countries where they have actively operated, and the various brands and products they sold.
I will be basing my observations on Profit, Sales, Units Sold, Cost, and Product. I have included filters such as Year and Country in this report to streamline visualization and help any user garner useful information readily.

CONCLUSION
Four measures created: Total COGS, Total Profit, Total Sales, and Total Units Sold.

FINDINGS
Across all metrics, the Government segment generated 65% of the profits, making it the backbone of the business.
The product Paseo raked in 28% of the profit share. With highest number of sells and incurring the lowest amount of cost, this product is their premier offering.
France generated about 23% of the profit, marginally leading amongst countries.
A key drawback is the Enterprise segment, incurring hefty loss. All throughout a year, this segment has consistently underperformed. The management will have to investigate to discover the root problem. As a start, all discounts offered for this segment must be immediately ceased to salvage the situation. Once the root problem is identified and appropriate remedial measures are implemented, this segment will hopefully start showing positive outcomes.
